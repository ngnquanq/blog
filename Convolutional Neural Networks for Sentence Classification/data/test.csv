It did in some parts, but I felt that it changed or left out stuff that would have been just as easy to leave in. Such as, Professor Snape's potions charm that is an obstacle to the Sorcerer's Stone was left out. Also, in that same scene Harry not playing the flute that Hagrid gave him to soothe Fluffy.

"Redundant and self deprecating: What a stupid book! I could not help using childish terms to describe this book. The whole jist of the book is to flip back and forth between the hero, then the heroine, in feeling sorry for himself/herself in order to squeeze sympathy from its readers. The first one or two times it may have worked, but after the 20th and 30th repetition of how the hero feels inferior, or the heroine felt abandoned etc...I couldn't care less about either one of them. The book read as if the author wrote one passage, forgot she already wrote about that thought and then repeated the whole scenario in a different setting again and again in its subsequent chapters.

"The Duke's Got to Know His Limitations: An aging John Wayne looks uncomfortable emulating Clint Eastwood in this routine crime thriller. Released two months after ""Magnum Force"" blew away the box office, ""McQ"" (1974) has its virtues - notably director John Sturges' penchant for slam-bang action sequences and Wayne's strong chemistry with Colleen Dewhurst (who makes the most of her disappointingly small role).

Great Idea Looks Awesome... Bad Quality: Makes a mess. If you plan on putting the spice cans on any colored metal appliances in the kitchen. ((Bad idea) the magnets are made of the soft cheap stuff. So it leaves behind dark rings of muck. So best to just use the steel panel that it comes with if your appliances are any color other than black. Also the magnets are not very strong so if you bump one get ready for a domino show one will knock of two. Two will get three till everything below the one you're messing with is on the floor. (((If you wish it to be completely vertical. This all changes if you're going with a slop or horizontal set up. But the whole point of the product for me was to put it vertical to save space.Canisters are pretty cheaply made as well they do not screw on like you would think. They pop on. Not conducive to a long lasting design.All in all GREAT!!! Idea...

"What a RIPP-OFF!: JAK used to be an auto-buy for me and though I was hesitant about her earlier book, Light In Shadow, it did turn out a little better than I expected. Not so with Truth Or Dare. JAK finished Ethan and Zoe's story just fine in Light In Shadow and if she felt it needed more, then it would have been better to lengthen it with a couple more chapters. I expected this book to be about Arcadia's story but no such luck. It was Ethan and his baggage dragged around even longer and Zoe's insecurity over her marriage and husband making me cringe.I saw no reason for writing an entire book just to continue Ethan's and Zoe's story. I was expecting a new suspense plot but there wasn't. Arcadia's character was also inserted as if JAK happened to remember she was in the previous book and so merited a casual inclusion.This book was lacking in everything that had made JAK one of my favourite authors.

"Nice idea, but...: ""My Father Had a Daughter"" is a good, quick read, but falls down seriously in two places. The first is the device of having her run away to London disguised as a boy and playing Viola; like it or not, this is going to make people think of another Viola in ""Shakespeare in Love"" though the end result is slightly different. The second, and greater, obstacle to realism is the fact that it's well-documented that Judith Shakespeare, far from reading and writing fluently, was actually quite illiterate; Samuel Schoenbaum mentions it in his life of Shakespeare, and shows a picture of a document where Judith had made her ""mark"" with someone else signing her name for her.

"Boring - Just Like A ""Dick & Jane"" Book: As a diehard Carrey fan, I found this title to be an insipid disappointment. It's nearly devoid of Carrey's usual energy, creativity, and humor. Although the film manages an occasional comedic moment, they're far overshadowed by its cheerless plot and repugnant values. Carrey plays a businessman who looses his job and resorts to armed robbery to sustain his lavish lifestyle. The movie could have succeeded as a dark comedy. As is, we're stuck with corrupt, two dimensional, characters who we're supposed to laugh with and cheer for. This inherent paradox dooms the movie before it even begins.",0,boring like dick jane book diehard carrey fan found title insipid disappointment nearly devoid carrey usual energy creativity humor although film manages occasional comedic moment far overshadowed cheerless plot repugnant values carrey plays businessman looses job resorts armed robbery sustain lavish lifestyle movie could succeeded dark comedy stuck corrupt two dimensional characters supposed laugh cheer inherent paradox dooms movie even begins

Also, not only do the mags not hold very much, but the gun also has very little range and power(around 30-40 yards).

"The premise is nothing new: First,as a lover of design in all its forms, I disagree with the book's premise that current decorating TV shows and magazines don't talk to me. My favorites talk to me all the time. So, that claim simply isn't true. Second, I did like looking through the book, but there wasn't anything new in it about decorating in my own, albeit eccentric way. Again, that message (about doing my own, often quirky thing) comes through again and again in all the decorating TV shows, magazines,and books that I already enjoy. The thing about this book is that it doesn't speak to me all that well. In part,it's because the rooms aren't very well-designed. Some are downright tacky. I think a lot of readers will find these settings hard to relate to. I'm giving my copy of this book away, because it doesn't have any lasting value for me.",0,premise nothing new first lover design forms disagree book premise current decorating tv shows magazines talk favorites talk time claim simply true second like looking book anything new decorating albeit eccentric way message often quirky thing comes decorating tv shows magazines books already enjoy thing book speak well part rooms well designed downright tacky think lot readers find settings hard relate giving copy book away lasting value

"Colored backing defeats purpose: I have one bad eye. It doesn't look funny from the outside, but when I'm in a theatre watching a performance (live or movies) I like to cover the bad eye so it doesn't undermine the clarity of my vision. So I got these patches so I'd have something around to cover the bad eye. I liked the different colors, kind of fun. However the backing of these patches are the same color as the front. This can be distracting because now my bad eye is seeing nothing but pink or green or whatever. This undermines the benefits of wearing the patch. I'm sure that these patches would be fine for a children's party but for those who need patches to improve vision in a darkened theatre, better to get a patch with a black background.",0,colored backing defeats purpose one bad eye look funny outside theatre watching performance live movies like cover bad eye undermine clarity vision got patches would something around cover bad eye liked different colors kind fun however backing patches color front distracting bad eye seeing nothing pink green whatever undermines benefits wearing patch sure patches would fine children party need patches improve vision darkened theatre better get patch black background
"Deadly boring and gross waste of Steve Carell's talents: I thought this was going to be a funny movie about a shy guy finally finding sex and true love. Instead it was an Animal House-kind of mindless, crude, dumb and boring string of tasteless scenes about a not-especially-shy guy with a bunch of really clueless friends who, if you are to believe the picture presented, are the least attractive, sexually alluring males on the planet, with a bunch of female friends and acquaintances who are equally crude and stupid. After about ten minutes of this film, the friend with whom I was watching it asked if we could find something better to watch. Later on, I went back and watched most of the rest of it, hoping that somehow it would improve or I would be able to see why it had gotten favorable reviews. No such luck. Do yourself a favor--if you have to see this movie, rent it and have something actually entertaining ready for backup.

Not so happy...: I bought this pedometer several years ago and never really thought it was accurate. I ended up putting it in a draw and forgetting about it. This summer I took it out and tried it again... not that it was going to be different but.. hope springs eternal.. right? Not so. I have been using it every day for 2 weeks and literally walking my arse off and it is not calculating right at all. I agree with the other reviewer that said it may catch maybe 50% of the steps.

"Unbearable: I am afraid that Night Shyamalan is one of those one-hit wonders. The Sixth Sense was fantastic, but every movie since then has been a wash. This one, like all his recent endeavors, had a good basic premise, but under the weight of bad writing, bad directing, and a totally self-contradictory plot (how can the ""bad guy"" be criminally ""insane"" if the ""good guy"" actually IS a super hero?) it sank like a stone. The acting was stiff and unconvincing. Spencer Treat Clark had clearly been told to ""hesitate"" and, with the reliability of a robot, he did so on every sentence. Robin Wright Penn looked justifiably pained throughout the ordeal. And Bruce Willis was only slightly less paralyzed than Samuel L. Jackson. The fact that all of these actors can act quite well but didn't in this film, needs to be laid at the door of the director.

"doesn't last long, too expensive, outdated vs. LED: I have 8 of these in my kitchen due to a California mandate on my kitchen remodel, which was done in 2007.I have replaced all of them at least twice, and some as many as 3 times.I have bought the GE F26TBX every time, because that's the only thing out there.It is therefore safe to conclude that the life of these bulbs is VERY POOR (< 2 years average).Given their high cost vs. incandescent, they are a RIPOFF!

"No no no no: Unlike the Zyliss ""Transparent Rapid Food Chopper A-1"" or the Zyliss ""Comfort Chopper"", this model's fatal flaws are the slanted sides and reduced footprint of the chopping blade.

"Extremely Basic...Not for kids over age 6.: I bought this book for my 9 year old with ADHD with the hopes that it might give him some insight to what the disorder is. This book is more for a 5-6 year old, maybe even younger. The ideas it gives to kids to help with their struggle are extremely basic common sense and not at all creative or very helpful at all. In the ""gaining control"" part that's supposed to give ideas on what can help the kids it says they need to make friends, take their meds and become more organized - with some really basic ideas on how to do those things (ex. to pay better attention at school take notes. YEAH RIGHT, I'm sure he's going to take notes when nobody else in the class is doing so!)...anyway, it says this book is for ages 8-13 but it is DEFINITELY not.

"Nice looking, but sloppy feeder: At first, I was quite pleased with the feeder. It looks nice and the birds (although restricted to small birds) frequented this feeder often, to the point where I was going through bird seed fairly quickly. However, when I took a closer look, I found most of the bird feed on the ground. When I started watching the birds very closely, I would estimate that for every seed the bird took from the feeder, 3 or 4 seeds would fall to the ground. The feeding holes are fairly large and I expect this contributes to the seed falling out.",0,nice looking sloppy feeder first quite pleased feeder looks nice birds although restricted small birds frequented feeder often point going bird seed fairly quickly however took closer look found bird feed ground started watching birds closely would estimate every seed bird took feeder 3 4 seeds would fall ground feeding holes fairly large expect contributes seed falling
"The Pigman is not that great!: When I read The Pigman, I was not that impressed. I had higher expectations for this book. The book was well written but the story was to unrealistic. The things that happen just dont really happen in reality.

They were doing their daily prank calls and Lorraine calls this man and John talks him into giving money to a fake charity. They go to get the money and end up becoming good friends and visit him eveyday. He gets his name the Pigman because he collects pigs. One day they decide to roller skate around the house when the Pigman has a heart attack.

"Left wing hack: This book is written through a leftist perspective and is full of resentment for the late Shah of Iran and the United States of America. The author thinks the entire terrorism thing is a result of 1953 coup against PM Mossadeq but the truth to the matter is that the hatred for the west existed hundreds of years before the events of 1953 or even 1979 for that matter. Radical Islamic terrorists hated the western way of life way before the 1953 coup. And the author fails to grab this fact. Yes, the coup was a mistake but when we put it in Iranian historical context it was a wise and important decision. Shah put PM Mossadeq in power in 1951 and when he asked Mossadeq to resign, he resisted and it resulted in the ugly events of 1953.

"There is evil in this world...: A colleague asked me to read this, otherwise I never would have picked it up. And to be honest, I am not thrilled I read it.I am just not into this sort of stuff. The book is supposedly based on the teachings and ideas of Jesus, but boils down to a pop psychology, ""believe in yourself and all will be well"" type of message.The basic gist of the book is that if you just recognize that nothing is good and nothing is evil, then nothing can have power over you, and the karma of the universe will come back to give you health and blessings.What a load of crap.While I agree that many of the things we call good and evil are not inherently good and evil (a knife, cancer, alcohol, etc), these things can be used for very good or very evil actions. This is the glaring flaw in the book. He kept writing about inanimate objects, and diseases as being morally neutral. Fine.

"Not sure what it is good for: I've just started reading this, so my comments are preliminary. The good parts about this book is that there is a lot of visual aids and a lot of logical steps for doing things. Plus, the author does a very good job of setting up hands-on activities for for the user to do. However, my complaint is that too much time spent explaining very basic functions that most illustrator users would already know. How to save? how to change the font? Potential buyers might consider looking at the advanced book first (which also covers Photoshop) or buying both books in combination. Otherwise, this book is for people who really are starting fresh and might not well experienced in Illustrator at all. Perhaps one of the problems is that this book duplicates the manual and the writer is left with explaining the obvious.

Not Worth The Money: My previous Milwaukee drill worked like a champ for over fifteen years. I wanted to get the same quality so I went with Milwaukee again. The 5380-21 failed after approximately 50 holes in the hammer mode. The chuck stopped turning after less than an hour of use. I finished the job with a Hitachi drill costing less than half of the price. Milwaukee lost their legendary quality when they moved their manufacturing facilities to China. I am so disappointed.

"Garbage dressed up as postmodernism: This film is dire, self-satisfied, pretentious and - more importantly -dull. A 90 minute examination of Steve Coogan's (fictionalized?) ego is only clever and postmodern if you happen to be Steve Coogan or a member of his immediate family. Is he a bigger star than Rob Brydon? Will he cheat on his wife with the pretty assistant? I don't care and neither should you. The only question I am interested in is why Michael Winterbottom saw fit to touch this steaming pile of smug middle class turd when he could have been making another film with a point and a social conscience, qualities with which he is more usually associated.

"Don't Waste Your Time & Money!: What a piece of junk! I have owned all SONY gear for more than 20 years and thought SONY and SONY ES AV equipment was very good. I upgraded to a 50"" plasma in the last year and new 7.1 receiver and 400 disk DVD. I also decided to upgrade my remotes and go to an universal, one remote does it all. Naturally I leaned toward the SONY and bought the RM-AV3100. Unfortunately, I have finally run into something that SONY makes that is worthless! None of my SONY equipment would work and the instructions in the manual instruct you to do one thing and it's like the remote and the manual are not for the same model. It took more than 30 minutes to set the clock! After deleting the preset button's info, it would finally accept a new code.SONY customer service could only refer me back to the manual.I consider myself somewhat electronics literate but this remote is more than I can handle.

"Has an off-taste, weak: I was really excited by Better Than Bouillon. Especially when making risotto, I have been searching for a good chicken bouillon to make life easier.Preparing it is very simple, and the jar sits easily in the fridge.The taste is, however, lack luster. I found myself adding extra just to get any real flavor, and even then, there was no strong chicken taste. Didn't serve to heighten the flavors, or add aroma.Given the high price (and the Amazon price is higher than in many stores), this isn't worth it.

In other words, people die, and sometimes in an awful way, but also there is a kind of wisdom and moral that is also passed on despite bad events. Mention is made of the wonderful special effects. They're ok. Good enough (but I just saw Return of the King -- so I'm spoiled). But it's the script that wins you over (and the acting).

"Very nice idea...: I love the idea of a half loaf. It is a nice change from the normal rectangular loaf pans. What I like: The shape - it's cool looking. The size - it's small and cooks quickly. It's made in Germany - not China.What I don't like: The pan is thinner than I am used to. The non-stick stuck. The size - it's small and does not hold much. Most recipes will need a second pan.

"Another look from the top of command:: Insight is key to this book written by Grant from basically his death bed. What we learn from Grant in this book gives us an opportunity to understand his intentions, strategies and how he worked with people. Grant tries to be very fair in his writing that covers his early days as a colonel to full-fledged commander of the US Army. His style is basic and easy to understand. At times the book feels like he is giving a history lesson about the war and sometimes is vague about triumphs or failures. I was looking forward to reading about Grant's work with the battle of Cold Harbor and he was completely brief in this book considering it was a major conflict. But, this was Grant's choice to write and memoir depth is subject to author decision. Grant does pack a lot of information in and also has interesting coverage in regards to Lee's surrender. Anyone studying Grant or looking for further insight owes it to themselves to consider reading this book.",1,another look top command insight key book written grant basically death bed learn grant book gives us opportunity understand intentions strategies worked people grant tries fair writing covers early days colonel full fledged commander us army style basic easy understand times book feels like giving history lesson war sometimes vague triumphs failures looking forward reading grant work battle cold harbor completely brief book considering major conflict grant choice write memoir depth subject author decision grant pack lot information also interesting coverage regards lee surrender anyone studying grant looking insight owes consider reading book

"From American Record Guide: ""Michelangeli was obsessed with playing only the perfect piano--which, of course, does not exist. He worked intently for hours with his personal technician before every concert and recording session, to prepare the piano to his idealized condition. He once cancelled four out of five recitals in Russia because he was dissatisfied with the condition of his own piano! The Michelangeli precision can leave listeners with a perception of a cool, calculating person whose interpretations are superimposed and artificial. Not all listeners view his playing as cold and remote. Michelangeli is eccentric, but also elegant. His perfection is not mathematical. He has beautiful tone quality.""The Ballades are contemplative and sonorous, almost mystical in scope. The Schubert is conveyed with charm, grace, and elegance. The sense of architectural design in these large-scale structures is impressive and convincing.""",1,american record guide michelangeli obsessed playing perfect piano course exist worked intently hours personal technician every concert recording session prepare piano idealized condition cancelled four five recitals russia dissatisfied condition piano michelangeli precision leave listeners perception cool calculating person whose interpretations superimposed artificial listeners view playing cold remote michelangeli eccentric also elegant perfection mathematical beautiful tone quality ballades contemplative sonorous almost mystical scope schubert conveyed charm grace elegance sense architectural design large scale structures impressive convincing

"Quality melodic hard rock: I don't know that New York band Wild Horses (not to be confused with the UK band of the same name) qualifies as an all-star group, since Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson is the only immediately recognizable member, but they are a pretty decent melodic hard rock band.The band's 1991 album Bareback, until recently their only release, is equal parts Warrant and Cinderella. It is fairly straightforward hard rock music, with some hair metal and Southern rock elements added to the mix. The musicianship is top notch, and former Shout vocalist John Levesque gives a very solid performance. Closing the album with a cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Tell Me Something Good"" was a nice touch, and not what you'd expect from a band in this genre.While I wouldn't call Bareback a must-have album, it is still well worth checking out if you're a fan of this kind of music.",1,quality melodic hard rock know new york band wild horses confused uk band name qualifies star group since dokken bassist jeff pilson immediately recognizable member pretty decent melodic hard rock band band 1991 album bareback recently release equal parts warrant cinderella fairly straightforward hard rock music hair metal southern rock elements added mix musicianship top notch former shout vocalist john levesque gives solid performance closing album cover stevie wonder tell something good nice touch would expect band genre would call bareback must album still well worth checking fan kind music

The detail becomes overwhelming as the tale goes on, with meeting after meeting of the conspirators laid out for examination.The story is mostly about the flawed personality and reasoning of the primary character, a former ADM executive, whom the FBI coddled and prodded as they built their case. His ulimate exposure is a surprise to the FBI, despite the many clues he left along the way. The cumbersome infighting among Federal Agencies is also laid bare.The events are well documented and is an interesting read for fans of true-crime stories.

I wish he was alive to give this a read. This book is packed with the most humourous tidbits that actually make the royals look human. The story about the Duke of Edenburgh smacking the secret service agent with a newspaper during a motorcade and the joke about the Queen, Princess Margaret, the hijackers and the Rolls Royce made me roar with raucious laughter, as did the joke about the cinematographer on page 304.

"Humidifier Filters: I have been using the Holmes filters for my humidifier for at least 10 years. I can order it online and shipment is quick. I actually use one filter per winter season when my house is too dry (I live in the Northwest where it is damp all winter long.). I run it for about 8 hours a day during the week and longer on the weekends. I toss it at the end of the season and order a new one, so that I have it ready for the next year. You can visually see when the filter is ready to discard. The life of the filter depends on the water quality where you live and the hours you run your humidifier. This filter is encased by a metal ""cage"" that helps it stand erect, so when it is saturated with water it does not wilt.

"Camel, not pyramid, power: Pyramids revolves within Prachett's representation of a very British, albeit magical, Egypt. Pratchett has some fun playing with classes, and the expectations and confinements imposed on all classes (especially royals, in this case). He also takes many amusing pokes at polytheism. A camel, going by the name of You Bastard, provides the rest of the hilarity expected (and delivered) with Pratchett's Discworld books.Unfortunately, the final sections of Pyramids are disappointing, failing to make much sense or be very funny. Of the nine Discworld books I've read (the first 8--Pyramids being the 7th--plus Going Postal), Pyramids is on par with Sourcery as being the least of the lot. Not that this is hugely negative, as Pratchett's least is still very good. But with 30-some Discworld books available, this one's recommended only for the most serious of Pratchett fans.",1,camel pyramid power pyramids revolves within prachett representation british albeit magical egypt pratchett fun playing classes expectations confinements imposed classes especially royals case also takes many amusing pokes polytheism camel going name bastard provides rest hilarity expected delivered pratchett discworld books unfortunately final sections pyramids disappointing failing make much sense funny nine discworld books read first 8 pyramids 7th plus going postal pyramids par sourcery least lot hugely negative pratchett least still good 30 discworld books available one recommended serious pratchett fans
"Fun BUT.....: Four years ago I had to take the Lego Star Wars games off the computers and hide it just because meltdowns would ensure when the computer time was over and my son hadn't achieved the next level. We put it on the computer again and both boys (now 13 and 16) still love this game. But I took it off the computer again because of the same problem--backtalk when I try to enforce a time limit. Maybe not meltdowns at age 13, but still difficulty in just turning it off no matter whether the next level is reached or not. I planned on selling both games, but might just hang on to them and try them again in a couple years. I don't play games now, but I did arcade video games when I was a teen and I can see how they can be addictive. My advice for a parent considering a game that has only few save places is SKIP IT. It doesn't help you teach self restraint because the pull of the game and the thrill of achieving the next level can easily cause a person to spend why too much time on it.",1,fun four years ago take lego star wars games computers hide meltdowns would ensure computer time son achieved next level put computer boys 13 16 still love game took computer problem backtalk try enforce time limit maybe meltdowns age 13 still difficulty turning matter whether next level reached planned selling games might hang try couple years play games arcade video games teen see addictive advice parent considering game save places skip help teach self restraint pull game thrill achieving next level easily cause person spend much time

The plot and story are wonderfully complex. Phillip Pullman is a wonderful author and has written this trilogy magnificantly. I must say that the beginnings are a little slow and dull but hang in there, it's worth it. It also might seem a bit confusing for some but it all comes together. I absolutly love this trilogy. It is hard to put in words my joy when reading it. I would recommend this book to anyone, young or old, which I have. The story only gets better and better with each book.

"It's System!!!: There really is no band in the world who sounds like System Of A Down.The musicianship of the band continues to grow and progress with this album. Daron has a much more apparent presence on this album.. His voice makes an amazing contrast with the lead singer Serj's. Though this does take some time to get used to. Daron's voice is quiet bizarre and very much an acquired taste.The album is only 38 minutes long. Most CD's hold anywhere from 75 to 80 minutes. While it works well with Hypnotize, I can't help but feel like these albums contain ""filler tracks,"" which could have been dropped for one single and more solid album. The content of the song is satisfying. The political message of each passionately sung tune is much more clearly written than previous albums.It's definitely worth picking up, the kind of music you'll get addicted to.

"Exquisite Fin-de-Siecle Musique!...: Caplet and Magnard were part of the Franco-Belgian school of late-Romantic [i.e., Wagnerian] chamber music at the Fin de Siecle.

"War Within, War Without: To be quite frank, Batte of Los Angeles is a modern classic. The things Tom Morello can do with a guitar frighten and excite. Zack de la Rocha has a glib tounge and a gift for writing lyrics. From the hard, loud, and fast songs like Guerilla Radio and War Within a Breath to the slower songs like Ashes in the Fall or Born of a Broken Man, this album is amazing. Unlike the mindless rock out there (can anyone say Limp Bizkit or Mudvayne?), Rage actually makes music and that music has a message in it.While I do not agree with all the political statements made by Rage (e.g. Communisim for one. I do think egalitarianism is a laudable stance to support.), they are some of the most talented artists out there. It is a shame that they have broken up.

"A interesting read on so many levels: I was glued to the book because it was able to give me an understanding of my feelings when it comes to the subject matter in this book. It took me quite a while to get through it because some of the stories caused me to take a step back and anaylize my feelings a bit more. I began to experience anger, sadness,depression, and a great appreciation for the author. There were times where I struggled to pick it back up and continue reading because of the candor brought out through his interviews. Other times, I could hardly believe what the people were saying, and other times, I was heart broken, and sad. Nevertheless, it was a facinating, thought provoking read. When I finally finished the book, I found myself saying that the book should be required reading in high school, and college curriculum. If you haven't heard of Studs Terkel, then I urge you to find out who he is, and read his books.

"Gray Matters: This is a strong, unique debut from such a super talent. Macy Gray growls with that she-ra soul, that Tina-Earth-Kitt, lazy groove Billie Holiday in a funked out, disco-ready, rhymthic blues sorta way. Macy may not be for everyone but that doesn't mean this sista is a one hit wonder. With the radio play of superifical, dry, booty songs, Macy Gray is a refreshing taste for those who want to hear some soul. For those who wanna hear that skreeching voice that sounds almost unreal, possibly surreal. This is for those who wanna expand in what they call music. Who don't pry themselves by the standards of what is current and pop. This for those who want something with spice, class, sass, and appeal.

"Perfect set for my 60D: Having been just a photography amateur I was seriously considering third party flashes like Yongnuo 468 II and Nissin 622 mark 2. The former has durability issues and the latter is a pro Nikon brand, missing functions like 2nd curtain sync and manual zoom. Then I realized the fact that I'm having a 60D and I need to use a good flash as long as I shoot. So considering both as a long term investment.When I received it I was surprised by the wireless TTL function. I was under the impression that it works only when the built in flash and sensor of 430 comes into line-of-sight. Its true that both pieces need to see each other but it works as if you have a ttl cord attached. So I dont have to buy an RF trigger unless I start exploring complex lightings.Few Cons: FEB, Bounce card, Stroboscopic flash",1,perfect set 60d photography amateur seriously considering third party flashes like yongnuo 468 ii nissin 622 mark 2 former durability issues latter pro nikon brand missing functions like 2nd curtain sync manual zoom realized fact 60d need use good flash long shoot considering long term investment received surprised wireless ttl function impression works built flash sensor 430 comes line sight true pieces need see works ttl cord attached dont buy rf trigger unless start exploring complex lightings cons feb bounce card stroboscopic flash
"Look Elsewhere: Though the Oxford Etymology is an excellent work, it doesn't read well as a dictionary - being essentially a selection of edited etymological notes from the Original OED. The scholarship is dry, and cryptic...

What's especially useful for American readers is that the Barnhart / Chambers is drawn almost entirely from American sources and scholarship.

"Superb even to a six year old: After twenty-five years,Dersu Uzala remains at the top of my list of the best films ever. The previous reviews describe this magnificent film quite well, so I won't add to it, but offer instead a story. About twenty years ago, my wife and I took her four small children, only one of whom could read at the time, to an art theater showing of Dersu. We knew this was a little risky; the response one might rightly expect from children that age to a long, slow moving, subtitled film would be squirmy boredom and complaining, but that is not what happened at all. Kurosawa's storytelling genius captured even these very young minds; they remained attentive throughout the entire film and despite the the fact that three of them had no way of knowing what the characters were saying, enjoyed it to the end. Kurosawa's cinematic mastery carried them along on those long-ago expeditions, and into the intimacy of a deep friendship.",1,superb even six year old twenty five years dersu uzala remains top list best films ever previous reviews describe magnificent film quite well add offer instead story twenty years ago wife took four small children one could read time art theater showing dersu knew little risky response one might rightly expect children age long slow moving subtitled film would squirmy boredom complaining happened kurosawa storytelling genius captured even young minds remained attentive throughout entire film despite fact three way knowing characters saying enjoyed end kurosawa cinematic mastery carried along long ago expeditions intimacy deep friendship

"Beautiful, but the book was better (See my About Area): While I thought that the cinematic vision of Benny's story was beautiful to see and certainly very well-cast, the translation lost something when it went from book to screen. It was unfortunate that the producers felt the need to rewrite the plot into a more pat Americanized version in which they glossed over the flaws inherent in some of the characters, taking away their responsibilities for their actions and making them instead victims of their own destinies.Ultimately, the movie was a feast for the eyes and ears, but the book was food for the soul.",1,beautiful book better see area thought cinematic vision benny story beautiful see certainly well cast translation lost something went book screen unfortunate producers felt need rewrite plot pat americanized version glossed flaws inherent characters taking away responsibilities actions making instead victims destinies ultimately movie feast eyes ears book food soul

This book treats the material in enough depth that I could finally understand what was going on. It uses real-world coding examples instead of silly stuff. (One book I read made you write a ""Jaberwocky"" class, for goodness sakes!) They cover OO design, for those of us coming from the procedural world. I recommend the book to programmer friends wanting to learn Java.",1,reading 4 java books finally found good one reading 4 java books remaining largely clueless book finally teaches topic enough depth real programmer make sense material borrowed friend learn java x days found skimmed material left questions mind would ever read book treats material enough depth could finally understand going uses real world coding examples instead silly stuff one book read made write jaberwocky class goodness sakes cover oo design us coming procedural world recommend book programmer friends wanting learn java
"Good Product - Klunky User Interface: I'm using the NSLU2 as a home backup server for 3 PCs. I have two USB drives connected to the NSLU2. Disk 1 for daily backups. Disk 2 for weekly backups of Disk 1. Works as advertised, but the user interface is anti-intuitive and painful to use.

"A great package: this is where to start for TurboJam: A friend recommended TurboJam, and I started with this package. This is a great set of videos that let you get into TurboJam at any level. There is a segment you'll probably only need once that teaches the moves. Then there are two short, easy routines to get started and to fall back on on a lazy day. Once you've mastered the basics, you still have an excellent long cardio segment, Cardio Party 1, and a great toning class. That is a lot of content for a single package, and it all works well together.Another note on TurboJam generally: I like a high energy workout, but have terrible knees after years of those high impact aerobics we used to do. I have been very frustrated finding a real workout that strengthens my kness, and doesn't leave me hobbled. Turbo Jam is surprisingly effective and low impact.

Good Shampoo: I wanted to try the Tea Tree Oil version of Miracle Coat as I have always been happy with the results of their other products. My dog got fleas which I solved with Capstar but his skin was irritated from the bites and looked like he had several hot pots that were bothering him. This shampoo does not foam much and made it a little hard to work in and I had to use up most of the bottle(113lb German Shepherd) but the results were very good with one caveat. Don't put this shampoo on any spots that may have open skin. I did and my dog almost chewed his tail off.The results from the bath left my dogs skin very clean and within the hour all his hot spots were nearly gone. His hair was the best it has ever been. The only downside is that you have to use a lot of shampoo to really get them clean.,1,good shampoo wanted try tea tree oil version miracle coat always happy results products dog got fleas solved capstar skin irritated bites looked like several hot pots bothering shampoo foam much made little hard work use bottle 113lb german shepherd results good one caveat put shampoo spots may open skin dog almost chewed tail results bath left dogs skin clean within hour hot spots nearly gone hair best ever downside use lot shampoo really get clean

I don't know if English is their second language or not, but in either case, they have learned all the necessary rock n' roll lingo and then some. All that can be said is this is flat out rock - period. Crunchy, catchy and fun.

"The Album Leaf - Into The Blue Again: The Album Leaf's post-rock/downtempo mood continues with INTO THE BLUE AGAIN, as ""The Light"" drifts calmly on soft layers of sound. But ""Always for You"" brings in the drums and the vocals, and tracks like ""Shine"" remind you that the Album Leaf is, at heart, a rock band, despite the electronic underpinnings. But that's OK!

"The best movie I&#65533;ve seen in the theatre. So glad to own it.: They used to promote movies as being a every-genre combination, ""filled with action, romance, laughs and drama,"" but it never really meant anything beyond poor story telling. If a movie tried this advertising approach now, everyone would think it ridiculous and refuse to see it. The amazing thing about Hana-bi (Fireworks) is, the combination really works. To even begin supplying plot details would waste your time and degrade the movie. It is a work of art in its entirety, including the original movie poster, which I'm afraid, is not on the box cover.",1,best movie 65533 seen theatre glad used promote movies every genre combination filled action romance laughs drama never really meant anything beyond poor story telling movie tried advertising approach everyone would think ridiculous refuse see amazing thing hana bi fireworks combination really works even begin supplying plot details would waste time degrade movie work art entirety including original movie poster afraid box cover
"In the Sabbath ""Second Tier,"" but Still Worth Buying: Perhaps the pressure was too great for our heroes to follow up on Heaven and Hell with another masterpiece, so instead they put out Mob Rules, a respectable though hardly life-changing release. Perhaps Dio was right when in an interview it was like the band was trying to repeat what worked; they never stoop to self-parody, but the disc never quite touches the soul the way its predecessor does. ""Turn Up The Night"" is like ""Son of Neon Knights,"" and we can make other comparisons, but Vinnie Appice sounds right at home, Tony's solo in ""Over and Over"" is one of his best ever, and the bass lines are (as usual) just mind-blowing.

"Intense, Entertaining Man's Movie: Wow, this is an intense story that should keep you interested for the full two hours. The five main roles are all men and they are pretty interesting, led by Danny Glover's character, who is very, very creepy. Lee Ermey, the fanatical drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket, is fun to watch in here. Jared Leto and Ted Levine also contribute nicely.I'm hesitant to say much about this film for fear of giving anything away for those who have not seen it. Suffice to say its a rough movie in regards to language, violence and general attitude but the story grabs you quickly and is tough to put down once you are into it.****possible spoiler**** It's true the story isn't really pieced together until the last few minutes., so be aware of that.

Protagonist, the Rev. Joel King, is no cutout caricature cleric. This man is real! He, like the Old Testament's King David, is ""a man after God's own heart"". A man who is flawed, yet faithful. Broken, yet not beyond repair. A rascal, who like the prodigal son, comes to himself; and makes his way back to the loving Father.Clark's book should be required reading in all theological seminaries.

I wasn't sure if my gun would hold in place inside once I carry them out. Surprisingly once all the latch is secured two rifles can fit in and stay secured without moving around.

"Decent beginner harp: I have read mixed and often scathing reviews regarding the Minstrel Harp and purchased the harp with some reservations. I agree with some of the negative comments (i.e. highest octave sounds ""klinky"" and the low C, D and E strings lack resonance). But over all I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. It's a cheap harp at a comparatively cheap price.I think it plays well and the mid-range strings (which are played most often) resonate beautifully. So lack of resonance in the lowest and highest strings isn't a problem for me.I disagree with a previous reviewer who said that it would cost about $2,000 to have a similar harp made. A $2,000 harp wouldn't have plywood soundboards.I think the Minstrel Harp is great for beginners.

At first I did not know what I was looking at because they had blurred the bodies out (I saw this in the movie theater, perhaps the DVD won't do this).

"The Best: I have been a school bus driver in Maine for 7 years. It was very hard to find a travel coffee mug that would keep coffee hot all morning. Coffee cools quickly when it is below 20 out. This mug keeps coffee hot for 5-6 hour easy. Driving a school bus, believe me, I need my coffee. The best part is how easy it is to clean. The design of the cover allows you to wash every bit of it.

"Overall goood - could use some upgrades: One of the main reasons I bought this bike trailer is because I wanted to be able to use it as a jogging stroller and wanted a large wheel - most other trailers that convert to joggers have a small wheel out front. This works great as a jogger, we used it in a 5K on dirt roads and because of the large wheels it was fine to push. However as a jogger it does NOT have breaks of any kind, this makes it very hard to get the kids in and out and does not seem safe for use on hills. My other complaint as other reviews have pointed out is the lack of formed/cushioned seats. The kids are strapped in securely but its not very comfy. One time I rolled the trailer - I cut a corner too short and the wheel hit the curb causing the trailer to flip. I did not have my daughter in a helmet (bad mommy!) however due to the roll cage she was not hurt! Overall a good product but could use a few upgrades.",1,overall goood could use upgrades one main reasons bought bike trailer wanted able use jogging stroller wanted large wheel trailers convert joggers small wheel front works great jogger used 5k dirt roads large wheels fine push however jogger breaks kind makes hard get kids seem safe use hills complaint reviews pointed lack formed cushioned seats kids strapped securely comfy one time rolled trailer cut corner short wheel hit curb causing trailer flip daughter helmet bad mommy however due roll cage hurt overall good product could use upgrades

"Overall very useful: I have used the gentle leader for at least a couple of years now. I have two little 20-25 lb. dogs that I walk twice a day with them on either side of me. When they were still puppies they would choke themselves with traditional collars trying to run ahead. When I used a harnass they would still pull. However, once I switched to the gentle leader they became much calmer. It's not perfect. They still try to pull when they see another dog or a cat, however, they are easily controlled and for most of the walk they trot along perfectly beside me.

"Battling monsters in Hawaii: In Fires of Eden, the talented author of such diverse works as Carrion Comfort, Song of Kali and The Hollow Man utilizes Hawaiian mythology to great effect. Fires tells the story of Eleanor Perry, a young woman inspired to visit the resort island of Mauna Pele by the events described in the diary of her great aunt Kidder. The diary relates Kidder's adventures on the island in 1866, when she and brash newspaperman Samuel Clemens teamed up to battle a horde of evil creatures threatening the local populace. From the time Eleanor sets foot on the island, she becomes embroiled in a similar adventure. Simmons alternates between the events described in the diary and Eleanor's modern day experiences, all the while building toward a gripping and surprising finale.",1,battling monsters hawaii fires eden talented author diverse works carrion comfort song kali hollow man utilizes hawaiian mythology great effect fires tells story eleanor perry young woman inspired visit resort island mauna pele events described diary great aunt kidder diary relates kidder adventures island 1866 brash newspaperman samuel clemens teamed battle horde evil creatures threatening local populace time eleanor sets foot island becomes embroiled similar adventure simmons alternates events described diary eleanor modern day experiences building toward gripping surprising finale

"A film that might annoy the serious Trekkie or Starwoid.: I was shocked by how entertaining this film was. I knew it was a comedy about Star Wars fans (Not a bad thing). But I was also surprised that it covered the underground hostility that Trekkies and Starwoids show towards each other. It is always funny to me (being a reseller) that Trekkies will not buy Star Trek stuff if it is next to Star Wars stuff and vice versa. So the scene in the film where some trekkies go into the (Windows?) comic book store and want to know the price of a Star Trek Phaser, really hit home with me.There are tons of other great scenes that also caught my eye , but I do not want to spoil it. Other unique quality of this film is the huge amount of cameos this show has -- such as William Shatner and Carrie Fisher.Overall a very funny movie worth at least 1 or 2 viewings.",1,film might annoy serious trekkie starwoid shocked entertaining film knew comedy star wars fans bad thing also surprised covered underground hostility trekkies starwoids show towards always funny reseller trekkies buy star trek stuff next star wars stuff vice versa scene film trekkies go windows comic book store want know price star trek phaser really hit home tons great scenes also caught eye want spoil unique quality film huge amount cameos show william shatner carrie fisher overall funny movie worth least 1 2 viewings

"Worked like a charm!: I bought this book about three weeks before I was to take my exam. I studied the book on and off for two of those weeks and passed with a 65. I have to agree with the reviewers who state that the practice questions in the book are harder than the actual CLEP itself. However, the greatest difference between the actual test and the practice tests is the lack of ambiguity in the possible answers. My one complaint with the REA book is that on many of the questions more than one answer could be correct. This is not the case on the actual CLEP test. Don't worry if you dont ace the practice tests... if you can score a 40 or above you should have a great chance of passing the real thing!",1,worked like charm bought book three weeks take exam studied book two weeks passed 65 agree reviewers state practice questions book harder actual clep however greatest difference actual test practice tests lack ambiguity possible answers one complaint rea book many questions one answer could correct case actual clep test worry dont ace practice tests score 40 great chance passing real thing
"Where was the commentary: I liked the movie but what I'm not getting why there really needed to be two discs? I mean one disc had a deeper look into the DCU that New Frontier had kinda explored then there was a JL episode, which was cool to see how the show did touch on the two earth theme. What I missed and was looking forward to was the commentary part. Where was that at and why was it not here? I never bought the two disc stuff but when I bought Public Enemies and there wasn't a commentary part on the single disc I figured maybe I need to start buying the two disc sets. The movie in itself is great, I liked it I watched it three times in row. I am starting to wish the movies were longer since they are now having way better scripts and stories in general.

"Fire Emblem: The Blazing Sword: I have mixed feelings about this game. The graphics and music aren't bad, and the writing is very well done, but I wouldn't recommend it for younger gamers.

The game can be extremely difficult, so you will probably need a strategy guide, unless you're experienced with this kind of game.You might not want to buy this if you're younger or more sensitive, though.

All blend together to make a lovely 'tapestry' for the reader to discover.That said, I believe ""Dragonswan"" by Sherilyn Kenyon, was the weakest of the four novellas. Though it was fun to read along with the rest of the collection, it lacked the 'weight' the other stories held. Additionally, it came across as a bit absurd. It was still enjoyable, especially when reading other similar tales, but left on its own, ""Dragonswan"" wouldn't have flown. This is the only reason why I felt the collection was not due five stars, instead of four.Regardless of the one weaker story, this is lovely book and enjoyable to read.",1,four excellent tales since reviewers given synopses collection merely add echoes praise tapestry truly wonderful group novellas often collections stories lack similarity difficult read tales blend together make lovely tapestry reader discover said believe dragonswan sherilyn kenyon weakest four novellas though fun read along rest collection lacked weight stories held additionally came across bit absurd still enjoyable especially reading similar tales left dragonswan would flown reason felt collection due five stars instead four regardless one weaker story lovely book enjoyable read

"Exquisite: I've read this book five or six times and it still reads like new every time. Jenn Crowell's talent amazes me: she was only seventeen when she wrote the book, she's never been married or had a child or lived in London, and yet all her words read authentically. Crowell is able to get inside Gloria's head and tell us the reader exactly what is going on, sympathetically and artistically. The characters are well-developed, the plot is fascinating, and the stylistic device--chapters in the present alternating with those set in the past--melds the book together seamlessly. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.",1,exquisite read book five six times still reads like new every time jenn crowell talent amazes seventeen wrote book never married child lived london yet words read authentically crowell able get inside gloria head tell us reader exactly going sympathetically artistically characters well developed plot fascinating stylistic device chapters present alternating set past melds book together seamlessly recommend book anyone everyone

"A lifesaver!: This book has become an indispensible resource for me. One of the huge challenges of being an ESL teacher is to figure out how to explain more or less logically what native speakers know intuitively. I am often stymied by grammar exercises in workbooks that are not properly explained, have too few examples, or the vocabulary in the examples is too difficult. Dixson avoids all these problems. This book is also great when you feel a quick review of a basic point is needed, or just for a quick quiz. What ESL student doesn't need to periodically review irregular verbs? You'll use it over and over once you buy it, guaranteed!",1,lifesaver book become indispensible resource one huge challenges esl teacher figure explain less logically native speakers know intuitively often stymied grammar exercises workbooks properly explained examples vocabulary examples difficult dixson avoids problems book also great feel quick review basic point needed quick quiz esl student need periodically review irregular verbs use buy guaranteed

"Excellent introduction to the Guard dog breeds.: The first thing one notices about this book is the large amount of quality color photos filling the book. This book was purchased by me to help me decide what type of dog to get. Not only did this book begin a domino efffect that would result in dogs being a hobby but I also became enamoured with the Pit Bull. This book was read by most of my friends who were looking for dogs and I think it helped everyone. The book is ordered very logically with breeds in alphabetical order and is very straightforward about physical and behavioural characteristics of each of the suitable guard breeds. When a dog is less suitable around children, the author lets you know. It is probably my favorite dog book and I now have quite a collection.",1,excellent introduction guard dog breeds first thing one notices book large amount quality color photos filling book book purchased help decide type dog get book begin domino efffect would result dogs hobby also became enamoured pit bull book read friends looking dogs think helped everyone book ordered logically breeds alphabetical order straightforward physical behavioural characteristics suitable guard breeds dog less suitable around children author lets know probably favorite dog book quite collection

"Good thoughts but poorly written: This book has many good thoughts and insights but is poorly written. A good editor would have helped this author immensely. It has bad syntax and sentence structure and was a frustrating and laborious read. I hope and pray that Mr. Rogers publishes another volume of this. He has wonderful insight which, unfortunately, becomes diminished by the lack of time that was spent on editing.",1,good thoughts poorly written book many good thoughts insights poorly written good editor would helped author immensely bad syntax sentence structure frustrating laborious read hope pray mr rogers publishes another volume wonderful insight unfortunately becomes diminished lack time spent editing
"Masterpiece !!: Simply an outstanding CD. Sounds just as great today as when it first came out almost 30 years ago. I hate categories and comparisons in music; how do you compare Mozart and Hendrix? You either like it or you don't. Without comparing, I will say early Firefall is comparable in style to early Eagles, i.e. a slight country flair to rock songs, with great, smooth vocals and absolutely killer guitar licks. Rockin' Bread songs are also a good comparison. If you've never heard this album, you owe it to yourself to check it out. While their other albums have some great moments, none ever came close to this in my opinion for consistency and overall strength. Definitely a top 50 of all time rock albums.",1,masterpiece simply outstanding cd sounds great today first came almost 30 years ago hate categories comparisons music compare mozart hendrix either like without comparing say early firefall comparable style early eagles e slight country flair rock songs great smooth vocals absolutely killer guitar licks rockin bread songs also good comparison never heard album owe check albums great moments none ever came close opinion consistency overall strength definitely top 50 time rock albums

"New 80's: It is like updated 80's music, but not the same updated 80's that other bands are doing. I like their one foot in dance music and one foot in rock music. I like the whole CD including the instrumentals some others seem to not like, especially ""Irreversable"" and ""Forever"".Now let us talk about the song ""Alive"". I can't believe it hasn't gotten more fave mentions. I can't stop listening to it at all. Very hooky and a fabulous guilty pleasure. I make no apologies for being madly in love with that song.When I first heard them I thought of The Cure (who I have also been listening to a lot lately). Music evokes Duran Duran/Daft Punk/The Cure. I am not saying anything new here that everyone else hasn't already mentioned. So get out there and crank the song ""Alive"" to the loudest volume possible.",1,new 80 like updated 80 music updated 80 bands like one foot dance music one foot rock music like whole cd including instrumentals others seem like especially irreversable forever let us talk song alive believe gotten fave mentions stop listening hooky fabulous guilty pleasure make apologies madly love song first heard thought cure also listening lot lately music evokes duran duran daft punk cure saying anything new everyone else already mentioned get crank song alive loudest volume possible
